# Password Manager

This is a simple password manager built with Python using the `cryptography` library. It allows you to securely store and view passwords for various accounts. The passwords are encrypted using the `Fernet` symmetric encryption scheme to ensure they remain private.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Passwords are encrypted before being stored in a file.
- **Password Viewing**: View saved passwords with decryption, ensuring security.
- **Password Adding**: Add new passwords securely to the password file.
- **Simple CLI**: Use the command line interface to interact with the password manager.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-manager.git

2.Navigate into the project folder:
cd password-manager

3.Install the required dependencies:
pip install cryptography

Usage
First Time Setup
Before using the password manager for the first time, generate a key to encrypt and decrypt your passwords. To do this, uncomment and run the write_key() function (you can comment it back afterward):
# Uncomment this to generate the encryption key for the first time
# write_key()
This will create a file called key.key, which will be used for encrypting and decrypting passwords.

Running the Password Manager
Run the password manager by executing the following command:
python password_manager.py

You will be presented with a simple text-based interface to choose between two options:

Add: Add a new password to the list.
View: View existing passwords.
Quit: Exit the application.

Adding a Password
To add a password:

Choose the add option.
Enter the account name and the password when prompted.
The password will be encrypted and saved to passwords.txt.
Viewing Passwords
To view stored passwords:

Choose the view option.
All saved account names and their corresponding passwords will be displayed (decrypted).
Note: Passwords are displayed only if the correct decryption key (key.key) is available.

File Structure
key.key: Stores the encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt passwords.
passwords.txt: Contains the encrypted passwords for various accounts.

Security
The passwords are encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme, ensuring that even if someone gains access to the passwords.txt file, they cannot read the passwords without the encryption key (key.key).
Important: Keep the key.key file safe. If you lose this key, you will not be able to decrypt your passwords.

Customization
You can modify the storage file for passwords (passwords.txt) or encryption key (key.key) by adjusting the corresponding file paths in the script.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Cryptography (Fernet encryption scheme)
